AI-powered data analysis and Power BI dashboards using the Superstore dataset

# 🧠 AI-Assisted Sales Insights Dashboard

This project demonstrates **data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **AI-assisted insights** using the popular **Superstore dataset**.  
It highlights my interest in **data management**, **business intelligence**, and **data storytelling** through Python and Power BI.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- Cleaned and analyzed Superstore sales data using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**.
- Built interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize key KPIs:
  - Total Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin
  - Top Performing Category and Region
  - Monthly Sales Trends
  - Customer Segmentation and Shipping Efficiency
- Used **AI tools (ChatGPT)** to generate executive-level insights and summaries.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, DAX
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI, Tableau (optional)
- **AI Tools:** ChatGPT (for data insight summaries)
- **Dataset:** [Superstore Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

## 🧮 Jupyter Notebook
The notebook `ai_sales_insights_dashboard.ipynb` includes:
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations  
- Exported clean dataset for Power BI

---

## 💡 Key Insights
> - Technology is the top-performing category by revenue.  
> - The West region leads in both sales and profit.  
> - Corporate customers yield higher profit margins.  
> - Sales spike in November–December due to holiday demand.  

---

## 🧠 AI Summary Example
> The Superstore dataset analysis revealed that Technology products drive the highest profits, with strong sales in the Western region. Customer segments differ significantly in profitability, and shipping delays impact specific categories. The Power BI dashboards visualize these patterns for improved decision-making.

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Add forecasting using machine learning (ARIMA or Prophet)
- Automate Power BI dashboard refresh via Power Automate
- Include anomaly detection for unusual sales or profit drops
